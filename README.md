## ‚öôÔ∏è Selling Logic

TokenSniper automates the selling process with the following steps:

1. **User Input**:
   - The user selects an exchange (e.g., 1 for OKX, 2 for Bybit, 3 for Binance, 4 for Gate.io).
   - The user specifies the asset symbol to sell (e.g., `BTC`) and the percentage of the balance to sell (e.g., `0.5` for 50%).
   - The script then initiates the selling logic.

2. **Balance Monitoring**:
   - Every second, the bot checks the wallet balance for the specified asset.
   - As soon as the balance becomes non-zero (e.g., when tokens arrive on the account), the selling process starts.

3. **Limit Order Execution**:
   - The bot retrieves the list of bids from the order book for the trading pair (e.g., `BTC_USDT`).
   - It calculates one or more limit orders based on the bid prices, optimizing for successful execution. The price is derived from the order book to ensure the order matches existing demand.

4. **Order Management**:
   - If an order fails to execute within 3 seconds or the market price changes significantly, the bot cancels the order.
   - It then recalculates a new order with updated prices from the latest order book data.
   - This process repeats until the entire specified percentage of the asset is sold.

5. **Completion**:
   - The bot continues placing and managing orders until all tokens are successfully sold, ensuring the full amount is executed efficiently.
